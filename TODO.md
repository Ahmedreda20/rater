Things to do and ideas
---

- Ajax post when rating done
- Mutable, nonmutable status
- Callback function
- ~~Set number of stars, initial value~~
- Set glyphs
- Set extra data and send (like id)
- Easy rate get/set
- ~~Set dynamic value for the stars (3 and 1/3 of stars full) when showing poll results~~
- Flexible options for different images, glyphs, svg, ...
- Tooltip support

- ~~options pattern~~
- remove method
- extra optional layer for faces, ...
- low priority: plus, minus buttons for adding, subtracting values. Also keyboard support would be nice.
